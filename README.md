# Overview
This assignment involves scraping data from the Mars News website and analyzing Mars weather data. It consists of two parts:

# Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News (found in deliverable_one_mars_news.ipynb)
- Use automated browsing with Splinter to visit the Mars news site and extract HTML code with Beautiful Soup.
- Scrape and extract titles and preview text of news articles.
- Store the scraped information in a Python list of dictionaries.

# Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data (found in deliverable_two_mars_weather.ipynb)
- Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site and extract HTML code with Beautiful Soup.
- Scrape the data into a Pandas DataFrame, ensuring correct column headings and data types.
- Analyze the data to answer specific questions such as the number of months on Mars and the number of Martian days' worth of data.
- Visualize the data to identify the coldest and warmest months, lowest and highest atmospheric pressure months, and estimate the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year.
- Export the DataFrame to a CSV file. (example of this csv file can be found in mars_data.csv)
